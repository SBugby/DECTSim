Thank you for considering contributing to our program! We value collaboration and encourage you to join us in improving and extending its functionality. Below are some guidelines to ensure smooth collaboration and maintain the quality of the codebase:

1. **Collaboration**: We strongly encourage collaboration among contributors. Feel free to discuss ideas, suggest improvements, and work together to enhance the program's capabilities. There is plenty of work to be done, and we welcome your input and contributions.

2. **Extendability**: When writing functions and classes, consider future extensibility. Design them in a way that allows for easy extension and modification, promoting the longevity and flexibility of the codebase.

3. **Testing**: Testing is at the heart of our program. We rely on comprehensive testing to ensure reliability and stability. We welcome pull requests, but they will only be accepted once the new code has been thoroughly tested and meets our quality standards. Please include relevant tests along with your changes.

4. **Documentation**: Clear and comprehensive documentation is essential for understanding the program's functionality and usage. We encourage contributors to provide documentation alongside their code changes and tests. Well-documented code helps maintain readability and facilitates future development efforts.
