# Developer Introduction

Some definitions to get started:

- **Class**: A blueprint for creating objects. A class defines the properties and methods that an object will have.
- **Abstract class**: A class that is not intended to be instantiated, but is instead intended to the base class for other classes. Abstract classes are used to define a common interface for a group of classes.
- **Function**: A block of code that can be called from elsewhere in the program. Functions can take arguments and return values. They can either be standalone or part of a class, if they are part of a class functions do not need to be called with an instance of the class, simply the class itself.
- **Method**: A function that is part of a class. Methods are called with an instance of the class, and can access the instance's properties and other methods.
- **Property**: A value that is part of an object. Properties are accessed and modified using dot notation, e.g. `object.property = value`.

In the description of each class, the following information is provided:
- **Purpose**: A brief description of what the class or function does and why.
- **Properties**: A list of the properties that the class has, along with a brief description of each including its type and default value.
- **Functions**: A list of the functions that the class has, along with a brief description of each including its arguments and return value and why it exists.
- **Methods**: A list of the methods that the class has, along with a brief description of each including its arguments and return value and why it exists.
- **Potential Future Changes**: A list of potential changes that could be made to the class in the future.
If any of the above sections are not present, it is because the class does not have any properties, functions, methods, or potential future changes.

## What is the Developer Guide?

The developer guide is a collection of documents that provide information about every class and function in the project. It is intended to be a reference for developers who are working on the project, and to provide a high-level overview of the project's architecture and design along with the reasoning behind it.
